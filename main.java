 * Ideas for implementing our detection algorithm:
 * - We have one process per boolean predicate
 * - Each one communicates to the others whether another process needs to
 * advance, as in stable marrige, or if the local predicate is false or not
 * - Algorithm only terminates once all the messages express to each other that there are no forbidden
 * states or that the local predicates can be resolved
